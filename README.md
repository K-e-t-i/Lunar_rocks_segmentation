# Lunar rocks segmentation

It's a university project based on artificial neural network and is used to lunar rocks segmentation. Software is written in **Python** programming language using the open source machine learning framework **PyTorch**.


The task is multi-class segmentation. Each class has been marked with a different color. The training data are in the *train* folder. The test data are located in the *test* folder.

## Scripts

- lunar_seg.py - it's a script to train segmentation model
- predict.py - it's a script to predict results
